# weather-station
Weather Station built using the Arduino Uno Board and Wunderground API

The purpose of this tutorial is to teach people how to use a **RESTful API** with an **Arduino UNO** board. We will build a weather station that displays the current temperature on a LCD display by pulling the current temperatre using the [Wunderground API](http://developer.wunderground.com).
